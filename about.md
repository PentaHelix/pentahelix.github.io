## About Me

Born in 1997, I am currently a student in Vienna.
I started to develop an interest for computers and anything related to information technology at a young age. Starting at 12, I began to teach myself programming. I started with HTML and JavaScript, but have moved on to a lot of different programming paradigmes and languages. At the moment I focus on making various game projects using C# with Unity, and Haxe.
