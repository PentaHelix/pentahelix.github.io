![Potion Inventory]()
Not a lot to show this week, as I have been primarily cleaned up code and optimized some scripts, however potions do now have their own inventory system which I quite like the ui/ux of.

<!--excerpt-->

Only a few things to show this week, the first one being potion inventory. You can scroll through a list of all your potions with [Shift] + [Scroll], and Drop them with [LMB]. 
![Dropping Potions]()

If you press and hold [LMB], you can charge up a throw.
