![Potion Inventory]()
Not a lot to show this week, as I have been primarily cleaned up code and optimized some scripts, however potions do now have their own inventory system which I quite like the ui/ux of.

First of all you might notice that the game looks a bit more colorful now, this is thanks to a suggestion by /u/kgtc you can see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/31ccqi/sharing_saturday_44/cq1t0n3)

##Potions
Only a few things to show this week, the first one being potion inventory. You can scroll through a list of all your potions with [Shift] + [Scroll], and Drop them with [LMB].

If you press and hold [LMB], you can charge up a throw.

##Spells
I slightly changed spells to make individual "Spellecules" spread out in a horizontal line rather than a circle. I did this because aiming a spell was really hard when spellecules spread out AROUND your (imaginary) crosshair instead of actually where you pointed.

##Misc
Chrawl is now migrated to Unity 5, I still need to port the Shader from IndieEffects to Unity ImageEffects tough.
