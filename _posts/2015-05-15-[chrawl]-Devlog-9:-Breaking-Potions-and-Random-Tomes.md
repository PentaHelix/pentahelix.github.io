Potions shatter on surfaces now, as well as some cool additions to Tomes.

<!--excerpt-->

#Tomes
I've just added a feature that displays the runes present on a tome when you look at them. This is necessary if the tome is too far away to discern individual runes.

Tomes are now randomly generated, however some runes are more uncommon than others.

#Chests
Chest now spawn in the map. Chest will contain tomes, potions, daggers, ... .
