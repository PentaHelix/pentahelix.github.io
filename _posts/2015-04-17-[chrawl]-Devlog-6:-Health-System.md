#Health and Mana
I am still working on optimizing code, and getting some basic game design done. I thought a bit about the health and mana system and decided to give the player an item which tells them how much of each they have left. My thought is to let the player lose/sell this item like any other to allow for some interesting strategies.

The magic system is going to need some reworking as well, however the core functionality will stay the same.
