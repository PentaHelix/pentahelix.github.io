I finally had time to get a lot done on chrawl this week. Chests are now working, alongside drinking Potions and a Minimap.

##Chests
Chests are now in Chrawl. They simply open when you look at them, and can contain a range of different items.

##Potions
Some Potions now have certain effects when you drink them. This is the Potion Of Frost's effect:

##Minimap
Also, there is now a minimap. I plan on making the minimap a spell as well, which means it will not always be visible.
