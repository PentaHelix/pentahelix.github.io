Hey everyone, Unity 5 was released recently (well, somewhat recently), and I thought I'd rewrite the tutorial for the ASCII shader to suit the Unity 5 Image Effects. I also made several improvements to it during development of chrawl. So here goes, ASCII Shader Mk.II

##ASCII Greyscale
To start off, you are going to need a texture with an ASCII representation of various greyscale values on it, ordered by brightness. I made mine in a sprite editor called [Aseprite](http://aseprite.org/), it should look somewhat like this:

If you need some help coming up with characters, take a look at [this](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/asciiart/), however keep in mind that if you draw your own characters, greyscale values may vary since your **B** might be bolder than my B, and therefore appear brighter.

Now with that out of the way, it's time to setup 

##The Scene
For this tutorial I created a basic scene with a few shapes and colors.

##The Shader
In Unity 5, an ImageEffect is made up of 2 components: a Shader to do the computing on the GPU, as well as a Script to control the shader. Let's start with the Shader. Here's a basic Unity ImageEffect PostEffectBase template: 
```c#
using System;
using UnityEngine;
namespace UnityStandardAssets.ImageEffects{
	[ExecuteInEditMode]
	public class ASCIIScript:PostEffectsBase{
		//Variables required for the ImageEffect
		public Shader shader;
		private Material mat;

		public override bool CheckResources (){
            CheckSupport(false);
            mat = CheckShaderAndCreateMaterial(shader, mat);
            return isSupported;
        }

		private void OnRenderImage(RenderTexture source, RenderTexture destination){
			Graphics.Blit(source, destination, mat);
		}
	}
}
```
If you know c#, this should all make sense to you, if you are using UnityScript learn c# :P (alternatively just accept this).

For the shader we will need a few values:
|Value   |Description                                    |
|--------|---------------------------------------------- |
|tilesX  |How many characters are displayed horizontally?|
|tilesY  |How many characters are displayed vertically?  |
|tileW   |How wide is one character?                     |
|tileH   |How high is one character?                     |
|darkness|Overall darkness of the rendered image?        |
