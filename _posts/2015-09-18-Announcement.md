chrawl(prototype) Open Sourced & Discontinued.
New chrawl in the works, sci-fi.

##chrawl Cancelled
You read it right, chrawl is cancelled. But fear not, a new one is in the works! After a lot of thinking about this I decided to take the nuclear option and start over. This is because of a few reason:

1. **Bad Code**: I started learning Unity when I started on chrawl, so naturally in the process of learning I wrote a lot of Bad code. And I mean a LOT. Reading through older systems now I get nauseous from time to time. This is why in a lot of Devlogs you see the words *"optimizing Code"*. Obviously I could just rewrite all of it eventually, but I felt like 90% of my time was spent by fixing the previous months 10%. This was frustrating and made me work even less on new things. 

2. **Theme**: chrawl started out as a fantasy game, heavily focused on magic. You might not have seen a lot of it on the blog but in my free time I did a lot of worldbuilding and had what I think is a really interesting world. However, I felt constrained by the fantasy(=>medieval) setting. A lot of times I wanted to do things like sliding doors, intricate traps, and other fun things, but they just could't fit into the world.
