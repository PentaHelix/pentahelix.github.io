Improvements to the minimap, as well as some other UI additions. 

<!--excerpt-->

##Minimap
The minimap is now permanently in the top right corner. When you start a game only the room you are currently in is shown, leaving you to explore the level and map out the hallways and rooms.

##Spells
Spells now glow, which makes for some cool visuals.

##Health
You can now look at your Pocketwatch, which will eventually indicate things like Mana.
