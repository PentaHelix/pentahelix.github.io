![Dagger]()

Hit things to make them die!

<!--excerpt-->

Hey again, made a good bit of progress last week. 

##Daggers
Finally got some daggers in-game. They are pretty self-explanatory, you hit things with them and they die. I'm thinking about enchantign them with tomes to give them some magical abilities, e.G. Dagger + Tome of Firebolt => Dagger of Fire Delivery
