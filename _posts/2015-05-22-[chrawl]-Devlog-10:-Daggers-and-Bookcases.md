Hit things to make them die!

<!--excerpt-->

Hey again, made a good bit of progress last week. 

##Daggers
Finally got some daggers in-game. They are pretty self-explanatory, you hit things with them and they die. I'm thinking about enchantign them with tomes to give them some magical abilities, e.G. Dagger + Tome of Firebolt => Dagger of Scorching and so on.

##Map Generation
I'm trying to make the world a bit more engaging, so I'm starting to add some furnishing into the dungeon. For now, there are some Bookcases without any functionality, however the book texture generates randomly so there's somethin I guess :) .
