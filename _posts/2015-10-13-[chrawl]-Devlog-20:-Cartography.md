In this week's devlog we will look into generating a procedural map.

<!--excerpt-->

Here is what a standard map in chrawl2 looks like:
![Map Side]()

As you can see, there are different rooms, with paths coneccting them. Rooms spawn at different heights, however no rooms will ever be on top of each other, which makes colission checking as well as a minimap easier. 

![Map Top]()

When generating the map, a room is represented as an object with certain properties:
```c#
public class Structure{
		public int x;
		public int y;
		public int w;
		public int h;
		public int z;
		public List<int> exits = new List<int>();

		public Structure(int x, int y, int w, int h, int z){
			this.x = x;
			this.y = y;
			this.w = w;
			this.h = h;
			this.z = z;
		}

		public bool Intersects(Structure s, bool margin=true){
			if(margin)return !(s.x > x + w || s.x + s.w < x || s.y > y + h || s.y + s.h < y);
			else return !(s.x >= x + w || s.x + s.w <= x || s.y >= y + h || s.y + s.h <= y);
		}
	}
```
The properties *x,y,z*/*w,h* are position/size as you would expect. *exits* is a list of 
ints from which paths originate. To explain this method we have to look at how rooms are built after they have been generated.

![Room Exits]()
