A lot of progress was made this week, including switching between Scrolls and Tomes, pseudo-deathanimations for gelatinous cubes, and improvements to stone walls.

First of all, here are a few visual changes.

Gelationus Cubes now explode into a green hailstorm of jelly doom.

It might be a bit overkill, but I'll leave it for now.

Stone walls now have bump maps to give them a 3d appearance. This didn't seem like a big addition at first, but it really makes a difference. Here's a comparison of casting a spell with and without bump maps.

Now to the magic system.
I implemented a way to swith between Tomes, Scrolls, and Simple Spells. You can see it in action here:

Additionally, I started working on generating Spells, expect to see some random spells in the next post!

Next week I will be in spain learning some spanish (yay...), that means no progress on chrawl or Devlog next week unfortunately. **I'll be back** in 2 weeks with a new and exciting devlog!
