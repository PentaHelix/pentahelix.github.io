Some more details on scrolls:

>Scrolls are inscribed with two runes that specify the effect of casting the scroll. Both Effects(Runes) are instantly activated when the scroll is cast. Certain combinations of effect runes will result in synergies, e.g. Shield + Lightning = nearby enemies are zapped for a duration of time.
