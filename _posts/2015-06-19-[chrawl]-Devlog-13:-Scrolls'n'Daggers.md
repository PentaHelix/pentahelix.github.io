##Daggers
![Dagger]()
Daggers are still very eary in development, however I do have some plans for how they will work in the game. A simple dagger isn't much of a weapon whan you have spells in your arsenal. However, enchanting them with Tomes and infusing them with their magical properties will allow you to create powerful daggers.

##Scrolls
I finally started working on the scroll rework. Here's some info:

>Scrolls play an important role in chrawl, as they are the primary source of non-		offensive magic. Scrolls will be randomly generated to some degree, similar to how 		Tomes are generated. Scrolls are a scarcity in chrawl, and are subsequently of very high value.
