##Scrolls
I finally started working on the scroll rework. Here's some info:

>Scrolls play an important role in chrawl, as they are the primary source of non-		offensive magic. Scrolls will be randomly generated to some degree, similar to how 		Tomes are generated. Scrolls are a scarcity in the world of chrawl, and are of very 	high usefulness and value. Scrolls are destroyed when they are cast.
