##Preparing a Plane
A simple plane will be the base of our terrain.

(2I scaled the plane up by 10)
Once you have your plane, in order to create low-poly terrain, we need more polygons. In edit mode, hit [W] to open up the "Special Actions" menu and select "Subdivide". You should see a small window pop up on the left. In that window you can select how many subdivisions you want. For this tutorial I am using 20.

However, for most low-poly art, triangles work a lot better than squares, so in order to make our quads to triangles, add a "Triangulate" modifier from the object Modifier tab.
