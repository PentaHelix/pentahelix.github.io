##Environment
My main focus this week was to make the game look better.

##ASCII Effect
I tweaked the ASCII Effect to be less confusing by slightly increasing the resolution, as well as adjusting the backdrop darkness for the characters.
So instead of just taking the pixel brightness and dividing it by a fixed value, it is now divided by 1/8 to 8/8 (depending on which character is being displayed). With this in place colors ramp much more nicely/
