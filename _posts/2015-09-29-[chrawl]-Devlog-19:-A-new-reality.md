Hey everyone to the first devlog for chrawl2 (that's what it's called for now, incredibly creative, I know). Since I've spent the past two weeks re-implementing many games, I started with my favorites (which are ProcGen Libs). So far I've got mesh generation and map generation working, a basic implementation of gun generation, and some texture generation. I'll focus on the Mesh Gen in this devlog.

I use procedural Meshes primarily for building up the map since I want it to be dynamic and also efficient. In chrawl1 I used to construct a map by placing a 30 x 40 grid of blocks and empty spaces. This worked for some time, but later when I added shops and such I had to awkwardly resize and move some blocks, it got relly messy. So for chrawl2 I wanted to go for something more "lightweight" and simple. For this nwe approch I am generating a list of rooms and paths connecting them and then creating custom meshes to build the walls of them.

```c#
public static GameObject MakeMesh(Vector3[] verts, int[] tris, Vector3 pos){
    	GameObject g = new GameObject("Wall");
    	MeshFilter rend = g.AddComponent<MeshFilter>();
    	Mesh m = new Mesh();
    	rend.mesh = m;
    	m.vertices = verts;
    	m.triangles = tris;
    	m.uv = new Vector2[]{new Vector2(0,1), new Vector2(1,1), new Vector2(1,0), new Vector2(0,0)};
    	g.transform.position = pos;
    	return g;
    }
```
