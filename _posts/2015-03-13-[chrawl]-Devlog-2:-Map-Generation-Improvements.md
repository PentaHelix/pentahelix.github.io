This week: Torches and gelatinous cubes in map generation, as well as Visual Improvements.
<!--excerpt-->

First up this week, here is the progress made on spawning enemies on the map, as well as spawning torches on certain walls.

Right now only gelatinous cubes are the spawning, because they are the only enemies in the game as of now. You can also see the pathfinding pathes.

Torches really make the map look better

As you may have noticed on the torch gifs, the camera is now bobbing up and down, and the hands follow the view a bit more smoothly.

I also got some work done on randomly generating magical spells for tomes/scrolls, here's a simple flowchart of the generating prototype.
