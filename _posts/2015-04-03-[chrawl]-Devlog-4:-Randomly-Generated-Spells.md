The last two weeks were pretty productive. I got work done on many different things, including randomly generated spells, item drops, and extending map generation.

##Random Spells
As I mentioned a few weeks ago, I am implementing a system to randomly generate spells. Right now, spells have random appearance and effects, e.g. color, size, trail, ... .

Some effects are also already working, piercing and homing among others.

##Item Drops
Gelatinous cubes now drop a random potion on death, in different shapes and colors.

Potions have no effect as of now, but I'm hoping you will be able to drink them in a week or two.

Some bugs you just don't want to fix...

##Map Generation
I have worked a bit on map generation as well. Halls are now one level below paths (random depth in the future), and stairs are placed to connect them.

##Enemies
I just finished the rough model of a new enemy, currently named "Sword Crawler" (original, I know).

He creeps me out a little bit.

That's it for this week, I hope to see you next week!
