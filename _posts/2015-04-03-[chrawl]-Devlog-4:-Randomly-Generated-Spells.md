![Too many potions?]()
The last two weeks were pretty productive. I got work done on many different things, including randomly generated spells, item drops, and extending map generation.

##Random Spells
As I mentioned a few posts ago, I am implementing a system to randomly generate spells. Right now, spells have random appearance and effects, e.g. color, size, trail, ... .
