![Too many potions?](http://i.imgur.com/DlCmCXy.gif)
The last two weeks were pretty productive. I got work done on many different things, including randomly generated spells, item drops, and extending map generation.

##Random Spells
As I mentioned a few weeks ago, all or most of the spells in chrawl will be randomly generated. Right now, spells have a randomly generated appearance(color, size, trail, ..).

Some effects are already working as well, for example piercing and homing.

##Item Drops
Enemies now drop a potion when they die. Potions have a random color and different shapes.

There are no effects for potions yet, but I'm hoping you will be able to drink them in a week or two.

Some bugs you just don't want to fix...

##Map Generation
Maps are now a lot more interesting. Halls are one level lower than paths (random depth in the future), and stairs are placed to connect them.

##Enemies
I just finished the rough model of a new enemy, currently named "Sword Crawler" (original, I know). It is a sword insect hybrid, which is not something you generally want to come across on your andventures.

He's pretty creepy.


That's it for this week, I hope to see you next time!
