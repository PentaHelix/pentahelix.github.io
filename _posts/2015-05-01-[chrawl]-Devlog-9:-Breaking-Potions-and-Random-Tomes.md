![Breaking Potion]()
Potions shatter on surfaces now, as well as some cool additions to Tomes.

<!--excerpt-->

#Tomes
I've just added a feature that displays the runes present on a tome when you look at them. This is necessary if the tome is too far away to discern individual runes.

![Rune Display]()

Tomes are now randomly generated, however some runes are more uncommon than others.

#Chests
Chest now spawn in the map. Chest will contain tomes, potions, daggers, ... .
