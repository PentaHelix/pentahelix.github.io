Finally got around to adding some new Enemies;

<!--excerpt-->

##Enemies
After only having the gelatinous cubes in the game, I finally implemented a new one. Right now, the cultist just follows you around and is generally a creepy guy. With his glowing eyes and red robes he's basically a jumpscare machine.

I also worked on another new enemie, he's got his eye on you. But more on him next week.

##Potions
I added effects for some potions, mainly the potion of burning and the potion of healing.
