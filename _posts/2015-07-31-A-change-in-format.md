As you will most likely have seen, the blog looks a lot different than it did last week. 
This is because I am changing the format of how I write these chrawl devlogs. Recently, I just felt like I don't get enough done to allow for an interesting weekly update, but instead most of it just being a few gifs with some filler text. So instead, this blog now focuses mostly on screenshots and other media that I upload as soon as I have something new to share, and write devlogs about major additions, design decisions and so on. You can view the screenshots/gifs on the main page [here](http:pentahelix.github.io), as well as discuss them. That's all for now, and thank you for understanding :)
