A lot of guns, a lot of Systems

<!--excerpt-->

Hey everybody, this week I'll explain how gun-generation works in chrawl. As a note, I have not yet finished GunGen, however most of the key systems are in place and it's all down to content now.

Every Gun is built up from 5 "modules". These modules are *body*, *barrel*, *magazine*, *optics 1*, and *optics 2*.
