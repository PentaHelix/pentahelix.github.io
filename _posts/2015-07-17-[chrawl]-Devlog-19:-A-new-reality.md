Hey everyone to the first devlog for chrawl2 (that's what it's called for now, incredibly creative, I know). Since I've spent the past two weeks re-implementing many games, I started with my favorites (which are ProcGen Libs). So far I've got mesh generation and map generation working, a basic implementation of gun generation, and some texture generation. I'll focus on the Mesh Gen in this devlog.
