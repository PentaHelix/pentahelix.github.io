For the few people that frequent this blog (both of you), you might be asking yourself why the updates have slowed down. This is due to 2 reasons:

1: A lot of the code I wrote when I started with chrawl is really slow and unoptimized because I had no experience with Unity. I have mainly been working on rewriting things like map generation, shaders, and so on. These things aren't really prime candidates for showing off, so I didn't bother writing a devlog about them.

2: Chrawl is the first 3d game I worked on, and because of that I often progress a lot slower than I would like to, and tbh, I find a lot of 3d work really tiring and frustrating. I hope that will eventually stop, but for now I just have to power through it. :)
