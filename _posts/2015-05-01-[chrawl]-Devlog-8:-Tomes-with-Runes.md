I worked a lot on runes this week, as well as implementing them in Tome generation.

##Runes

Here are a few of the runes I made this week. Each runes has a meaning and name, so you will eventually be able to read them.
I plan on designing en entire rune alphabet, and maybe letting players write their own tomes.

Right now, the four runes on a tome represent:

1. Effectiveness Type: Which kinds of enemies does this spell do more/less damage to.

2. Elemental Damage: Burning, Freezing, Stunning, ... .

3. Number of Projectiles: How many orbs does the Spell create.

4. Special Modifier: Powerful Runes, that make the Spell Homing, Piercing, Chaining, ... 
.


This week, I plan to complete Tome generation, and then maybe work on Map generation a bit.
