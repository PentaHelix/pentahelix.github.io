# Analysing your chances

## Context

For some time now, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding the CS:GO community regarding underage gambling. Recently, this was escalated when youtubers were found to decieve their audiences with "fake" winnings on gambling sites. This inspired me to write up a guide on how to calculate the chances of you winning on various gambling sites/games.

## Disclaimer

This guide will not show you how to win on gambling sites. "Winning" is not something you will be doing while gambling. Sure, there might be a few amazing wins along the way, but in the end, the ones who will be winning are the owners of the gambling site.

### TL;DR

You will lose.

## The games

While there are hundreds of gambling sites, they all feature essentially the same games. In this guide I will disect their mechanics and show you how you can calculate the chances of you winning, as well as bust some common myths.

### Myths

To start this off, I would like to finally make one thing clear. Past results can NOT influence new results. This means that when you are, for example, playing roulette, no matter how many times in a row red has been drawn, the chance of red being drawn again is the same as always.

*A streak of 10 reds*

A situation like this might lead many people to believe that red is less likely to be drawn now, since "What are the chances of red coming 11 times in a row?". Well it turns out that even after red 10 times in a row the chances are still the same. In order to understand this, imagina a coin flip. The first flip results in heads. Now, by the same logic, tails should be more likely to be the result of the next throw. However, how would the coin "know" what the previous result was? The conditions of the throw are exactly the same, nothing is different compared to the previous throw, which means the chances are exactly the same, as before. The same thing applies to roulettes, etc. Past results can NOT influence new results. 

## Roulette

Having cleared that up, we can move on to calculating actual probabilities. Let's start off with the most famous roulette strategy, the Martingale Roulette System. Basically this means that whenever you lose, you double your bet, until you win once, winning it all back.

Example:
Round | Bet           | Win/Loss      | Wins 
----- | ------------- | ------------- | ---- 
    1 | 2             | Loss          |   -2 
    2 | 4             | Loss          |   -6 
    3 | 8             | Loss          |  -14 
    4 | 16            | Win           |   +2
