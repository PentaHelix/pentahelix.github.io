#Analysing your chances

##Context

For some time now, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding the CS:GO community regarding underage gambling. Recently, this was escalated when youtubers were found to decieve their audiences with "fake" winnings on gambling sites. This inspired me to write up a guide on how to calculate the chances of you winning on various gambling sites/games.

##Disclaimer
This guide will not show you how to win on gambling sites. "Winning" is not something you will be doing while gambling. Sure, there might be a few amazing wins along the way, but in the end, the ones who will be winning are the owners of the gambling site.

###TL;DR
You will lose.

##The games
While there are hundreds of gambling sites, they all feature essentially the same games. In this guide I will disect their mechanics and show you how you can calculate the chances of you winning, as well as bust some common myths.

###Myths
To start this off, I would like to finally make one thing clear. Past events can NOT influence new events. This means that when you are, for example, playing roulette, no matter how many times in a row red has been drawn, the chance of red being drawn again is the same as always.
